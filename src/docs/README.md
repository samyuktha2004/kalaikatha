## 🏆 For Judges

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"Ramesh speaks only Tamil. His phone camera is scratched. Amazon dashboards are in English. He was stuck at ₹3,000/month—until KalaiKatha."

### Key Demo Moments
1. **Voice-first:** Speak name in Tamil → No typing
2. **Photo AI:** Scratched lens → Studio quality (92% improvement)
3. **Trade secrets:** AI splits content (public vs protected)
4. **Smart pricing:** "21% below cost" warning prevents exploitation
5. **Autonomous bot:** 24/7 negotiation while artisan works

### Closing Impact
"6 months later: ₹42,000/month. 47 international orders. 3 trade secrets protected forever. 100% in Tamil. This is how AI preserves heritage."
