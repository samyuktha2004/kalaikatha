Dear Al Habtoor Palace Hotel,

Thank you for your interest in my bronze Nataraja sculptures.

I can offer a 20% bulk discount for 15 units, bringing the 
total to ₹222,000 (₹14,800 per piece), and complete the

my family. Each sculpture is a one-of-a-kind solid lost-wax 
cast, not a mass-produced replica.

Does this work for your timeline and budget?

Best regards,
Ramesh
Master Bronze Artisan, Thanjavur
